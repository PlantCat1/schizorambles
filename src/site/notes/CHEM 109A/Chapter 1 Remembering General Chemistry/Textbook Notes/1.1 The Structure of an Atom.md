# Parts of an Atom
### Nucleus
- Center of an atom
- Contains protons and neutrons
- Contains most of an atom's mass
### Electron Cloud
- Where electrons inhibit
- Surrounds the nucleus
- Contains most of an atom's volume
# Subatomic Particles
### Protons
- Positively charged
- Found in nucleus
- Heavy
### Neutrons
- Uncharged
- Found in nucleus
- Heavy
### Electrons
- Negatively charged
- Found in electron cloud
- Move continuously, have kinetic energy
- Very light
- Form chemical bonds
# Values
### Atomic Number
- $Z=\text{protons}$
- Equal to the number of protons
- Unique to a particular element
### Mass Number
- $A=\text{protons}+\text{neutrons}$
- Equal to the number of protons plus the number of neutrons
- Not unique to a particular element
### Atomic Mass
- $\sum(\text{fractional abundance}\times\text{isotopic mass})$
- Average mass of the isotopes weighted by their relative abundance
### Molecular Mass
* $\sum(atomic masses)$
* The sum of all atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule
# Isotopes
Atoms of the same element with different number of neutrons
### Notation
$\ce{^A_ZX}$
Where:
- X is the chemical symbol
- A is the mass number
- Z is the atomic number
$X\text{-}A$
$\text{element name-}A$
### Radioactivity
Some isotopes are radioactive, and decay at a given half life
The half-life is the time for one-half of the nuclei to decay
