# 3.2 Naming Alkyl Groups
## Types of Naming
There are rules for naming organic compounds. A [[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Lecture Notes/Common Name\|common name]], and a [[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Lecture Notes/Systematic Name\|systematic name]], also known as the IUPAC name.
A higher number of carbons increases [[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Lecture Notes/Boiling Point\|boiling point]] and [[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Lecture Notes/Melting Point\|melting point]].
Substitutions (change in molecule's structure), change the physical properties

## Three-carbon Alkyl Groups
Propane: Three carbons
propyl group there are three carbons at the terminal end
isopropyl group if the R group at the center
Propyl chloride: Add a chloride to the terminal end
Isopropyl chloride: Add a chloride to the center
![Pasted image 20251102153727.png](/img/user/bs/Pasted%20image%2020251102153727.png)
## Four-Carbon Alkyl Groups

butyl group there are four carbons at the terminal end
isobutyl group if there is a methyl at the 2-position
sec-butyl group if there is a methyl next to the R group
tert-butyl group if there are two methyl's next to the R group

# 3.3 Naming Alkanes
![Pasted image 20251102150923.png](/img/user/bs/Pasted%20image%2020251102150923.png)
Identify the longest continuous carbon chain
If chain length is the same, the chain with the greatest number of substituents is use
![Pasted image 20251102151002.png](/img/user/bs/Pasted%20image%2020251102151002.png)
Place carbon chain numbers by having the lowest numbers
- If both directions yeild the same numbers, the group listed first alphabetically gets lowest number
Place the name of the substituent(s) in front of the parent hydrocarbon
- write as the carbon number, followed by a hyphen, followed by the subsistent name and parent hydrocarbon as one word
- If there is more than one subsisutent, place in alphabetical order with hyphens in between
If multiple of same subsistuent, list number comma number and add "di-" or "tri-"
- prefix is not included when placing in alphabetical order

# 3.3 Naming [[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Lecture Notes/Cycloalkane\|Cycloalkanes]]
![Pasted image 20251102151453.png](/img/user/bs/Pasted%20image%2020251102151453.png)
Ring is the parent hydrocarbon
- Add "cyclo-" to the parent hydrocarbon
Unless a substituent is larger than the ring
- then the ring name is used as a substituent

# 3.9 Structure of Organic Molecules
## Classification of Carbon Atoms
Primary (1°) positions have three or more hydrogen atoms. Methane or methyl
Secondary (2°) positions have two hydrogen atoms. Methylene
Tertiary (3°) positions have one hydrogen atom. Methine
Quaternary (4°) positions have no hydrogen atoms

![Pasted image 20251102152401.png](/img/user/bs/Pasted%20image%2020251102152401.png)

## Alkyl Halides
Compounds with carbon-halogen bonds
These have the same geometry as C-C or C-H
Halogen polarizes the bond
- help makes them reactive electrophiles
![Pasted image 20251102151846.png](/img/user/bs/Pasted%20image%2020251102151846.png)
Bond length increases due to larger halogens, this leads to more polarization and more reactive compounds.
## Alcohols
Compounds with carbon-OH bonds
These have the same geometry as C-C or C-H (sp³)
The non-bonding electrons occupy empty p-orbitals leading to lone pairs
- Lone pair can react as a nucleophile/base. Site of reaction with electrophiles/protons
- can engage in hydrogen bonding
![Pasted image 20251102152053.png](/img/user/bs/Pasted%20image%2020251102152053.png)
## Ether
Compounds with carbon-oxygen-Carbon bonds
These have the same geometry as C-C or C-H  (sp³)
Same situation as with alcohols with lone pair
- Lone pair can react as a nucleophile/base. Site of reaction with electrophiles/acids
- can engage in hydrogen bonding
![Pasted image 20251102152203.png](/img/user/bs/Pasted%20image%2020251102152203.png)
## Amines
Compounds with carbon-nitrogen bonds
These have the same geometry as C-C or C-H
Same situation as with alcohols/ethers with lone pair
- Lone pair can react as a nucleophile/base. Site of reaction with electrophiles/protons
- can engage in hydrogen bonding
Primary amine has one alkyl group
Secondary amine has two alkyl groups
Tertiary amine has three alkyl groups

# 3.10-3.11 Affects of non-covalent Interactions in Organic Molecules

## Interactions/Causes
### Branching Groups/Packing
Branching groups mean less surface area contact between molecules, leading to less interaction. Straight-chain structures allows for packing.
### [[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Lecture Notes/Dipole-Dipole Interactions\|Dipole-Dipole Interactions]]
Molecules with polar bonds are attracted to one another through dipole-dipole interactions
![Pasted image 20251102152853.png](/img/user/bs/Pasted%20image%2020251102152853.png)
### [[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Lecture Notes/Hydrogen Bonding\|Hydrogen Bonding]]
Hydrogen bonds are stronger than dipole-dipole interactions. Greatly increase the boiling point
## Physical Properties
## Boiling Point/Melting Point
Stronger attractive forces holding molecules together leads to a higher boiling/melting point

![Pasted image 20251102153117.png](/img/user/bs/Pasted%20image%2020251102153117.png)
### [[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Lecture Notes/Water Solubility\|Water Solubility]]
More carbon relative to substituents decreases polarity, which thereby decreases water solubility.
