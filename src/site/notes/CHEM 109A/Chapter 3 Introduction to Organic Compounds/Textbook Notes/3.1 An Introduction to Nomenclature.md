# Alkanes
[[Wiki/Hydrocarbon\|Hydrocarbons]] are compounds that contain only [[carbon\|carbon]] and [[hydrogen\|hydrogen]] atoms.
[[Wiki/Alkane\|Alkanes]] are a type of hydrocarbon that contain only [[single bonds\|single bonds]].
[[Wiki/Straight-Chain Alkane\|Straight-chain alkanes]] are compounds in which the carbons form a straight-chain with no branches.

These are an example of a [[Wiki/Homologous Series\|homologous series]], as each member is different by one [[methylene\|methylene]] ($\ce{CH2}$) group. An individual members of the series is a [[Wiki/Homologous Series#Homolog\|homolog]].
General [[Wiki/Molecular Formula\|molecular formula]] for a acyclic/noncyclic alkane is $\ce{C_nH_{2n+2}}$ where $n$ is any [[positive\|positive]] [[Wiki/Integer\|integer]].
# Methane, Ethane, and Propane
There is only one possible structure for methane ($\ce{CH4}$), ethane ($\ce{C2H6}$) and propane ($\ce{C3H8}$)

# Butanes
For an alkane with a molecular formula $\ce{C4H10}$, there are two possible structures.
The straight-chain version is butane, while the branched is isobutane.
The [[Wiki/Structural Unit\|structural unit]] of a carbon bonded to a hydrogen and two $\ce{CH3}$ groups is called "iso".
Compounds like these with the same molecular formula but different spatial arrangement are called [[Wiki/Constitutional Isomers\|constitutional isomers]].

# Pentanes
For an alkane with a molecular formula $\ce{C5H12}$, there are three possible structures.
The straight-chain version is pentane, while the one with an "iso" structural unit is isopentane. The third requires a new structural unit to be defined

# Hexanes
For an alkane with a molecular formula $\ce{C6H14}$, there are three five structures.
The straight-chain version is hexane, while the one with an "iso" structural unit is isohexane. The other three require a new structural unit to be defined.

# Systematic/IUPAC Nomenclature
[[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Textbook Notes/Systematic nomenclature\|Systematic nomenclature]] names a compound based on rules that describe it's structure. The one used by chemists is called the [[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Textbook Notes/IUPAC nomenclature\|IUPAC nomenclature]].
Compounds can have a [[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Lecture Notes/Common Name\|common name]] and a [[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Lecture Notes/Systematic Name\|systematic name]]. An example of the former is isobutane.
