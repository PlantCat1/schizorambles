[[Alkyl Groups\|Alkyl groups]] are made by removing a hydrogen from an alkane. They are named based on the alkane counterpart, but with the "-ane" suffix replaced with "-yl". A dash is used to indicate the missing hydrogen. The letter "R" can also be used to indicate any alkyl group

An [[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Lecture Notes/Alcohol\|alcohol]] is formed when a hydrogen in an alkane is replaced by an \ce{OH}$
An [[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Lecture Notes/Amine\|amine]] is formed when a hydrogen in an alkane is replaced by an $\ce{NH2}$.
An [[Alkyl Halide\|alkyl halide]] is formed when a hydrogen in an alkane is replaced by a halogen. This halogen is often denoted as "$\ce{X}$".
An [[CHEM 109A/Chapter 3 Introduction to Organic Compounds/Lecture Notes/Ether\|ether]] is formed when the hydrogen is replaced by an $\ce{OR}$, where R again refers to any alkyl group.

The common names of these compounds are given by the alkyl group followed by the class of compound with a space in between, unless it is an amine. For ethers, the two groups are listed in alphabetical order.![Pasted image 20251102224132.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020251102224132.png)
