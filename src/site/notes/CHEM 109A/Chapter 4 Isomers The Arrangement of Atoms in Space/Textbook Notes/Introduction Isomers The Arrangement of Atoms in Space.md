Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are two main types
Constitutional isomers differ in how their atoms are connected. Example is ethanol and dimethyl ether. Both are C2H6O, but different bonds to different atoms

Stereoisomers are connected in the same way but differ in how they are arranged in space. There are two main types
Conformational isomers (conformers) are stereoisomers that interconvert rapidly at room temperature and therefore cannot be separated. This occurs primarily due to rotation about carbon-carbon single bonds and due to amine inversion.
Configurational isomers are stereoisomers that cannot interconvert. As a result they can be seperated. There are two main types, geometric isomers (cis-trans), and isomers with chiral centers.
