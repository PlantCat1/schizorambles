# Amorphous Solids
Amorphous solids have considerable disorder in their structure. An example is glass
# Crystalline Solids
Crystalline solids have a regular arrangement of their components (atoms, ions or molecules).
Many different types of crystalline solids exist described below.
## Ionic Solid
Ionic solids are composed of ions. When dissolved in water the cations and anions separate.
An example is Sodium chloride $\ce{NaCl}$.
## Molecular Solid
Molecule solids are composed of neutral molecules. When dissolved in water the molecules do not separate.
An example is sucrose $\ce{C12H22O11}$
## Atomic Solid
Atomic solids have atoms occupying lattice points.
Examples are graphite, diamond, boron, and all metals

# Lattices/Unit Cells
The positions of the components of a crystalline solid can be represented by a lattice. This is a three-dimensional array of points each representing the center of the components. The smallest repeating unit of the lattice is called the unit cell. Therefore, a lattice can be generated by translating the unit cell.
## Simple Cubic
## Body-Centered Cubic
## Face-centered Cubic
