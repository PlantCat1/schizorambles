* Amorphous Solid
	* disorded structure
	* flexible, easy to bend
	* ex: plastic bag
* Crystalline Solid
	* ordered, repeating structure (lattice)
	* lattice = 3D array of atoms
	* smallest repeating unit = unit cell
	* 3 types
* Ionic Crystalline Solid
	* made from ions
	* ex: nacl
* Molecular Crystalline Solid
	* made from molecules
	* ex: ice
* Atomic Crystalline Solid
	* made from atoms
	* ex: diamond (carbon)
* Cubic Unit Cell (3D)
	* edges have = length
	* meet at 90 degree angle
* 2D Unit Cells
	* dont need = edge length
	* look for smallest repeating unit
	* unit can go to center or outside of an atom
* number of atoms inside 2D cell
	* in middle of cell = 1 atom
	* on corner of cell = 1/4 atom
	* multiple total # on corner by 1/4
* Unit cells must correctly repeat in all directions
