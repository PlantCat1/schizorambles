# Definition
A platonic solid is a [[Unit Cell Exploration/Polyhedron\|polyhedron]] with congruent [[Unit Cell Exploration/Face\|faces]], congruent [[Unit Cell Exploration/Edge\|edges]], and [[Unit Cell Exploration/Vertex\|vertices]], with the same number of faces connected
# Examples
 - a tetrahedron (four faces)
 - a [[Unit Cell Exploration/Cube\|cube]] (six faces)
 - an octahedron (eight faces)
 - a dodecahedron (twelve faces)
 - an icosahedron (twenty faces)
