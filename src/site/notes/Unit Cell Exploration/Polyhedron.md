A polyhedron is a three-dimensional figure with flat [[Unit Cell Exploration/Polygon\|polygonal]] [[Unit Cell Exploration/Face\|faces]], straight [[Unit Cell Exploration/Edge\|edges]], and sharp [[Unit Cell Exploration/Vertex\|vertices]].
# Types
## Platonic Solid
A [[Unit Cell Exploration/Platonic Solid\|platonic solid]] is a polyhedron with congruent faces, congruent edges, and vertices with the same number of faces connected. There are only five polyhedra that meet these requirements: a tetrahedron (four faces), a [[Unit Cell Exploration/Cube\|cube]]  (six faces), an octahedron (eight faces), a dodecahedron (twelve faces), and an icosahedron (twenty faces).
