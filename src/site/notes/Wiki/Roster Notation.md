**Roster notation** is a method of notation to denote a [[Wiki/set\|set]].  It lists the elements of a set explicitly. For a [[Wiki/finite set\|finite set]], the set in roster notation lists all [[Wiki/elements\|elements]] within braces $\{\}$, separated by commas. For an [[Wiki/infinite set\|infinite set]], the pattern of set elements is continued with $\dots$
Roster notation is ideal for sets with a small number of elements. For larger sets, [[Wiki/Set-builder notation\|Set-builder notation]] may be preferred.
## Examples
[[Wiki/Empty set\|Empty set]]: $\{\}$
The set of all positive [[Wiki/Integer\|integer]] less than 7 is: $A=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
The set of all positive integers: $B=\{1,2,3,4,5\dots\}$
The set of all [[Wiki/Multiple\|multiples]] of 5: $C=\{5,10,15,20,\dots\}$
